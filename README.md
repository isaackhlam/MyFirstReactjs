# MyFirstReactjs
This is my first trial on Web.\
I am planning to do a sudoku-related project with wave function collasp algorithm.\
I am following a tutorial to learn the basic of react.js\
This will be a tic-tac-toe\
The tutorial can be found here: https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html
# To-do
- [ ] Display the location for each move in the format (col, row) in the move history list.
- [ ] Bold the currently selected item in the move list.
- [ ] Rewrite Board to use two loops to make the squares instead of hardcoding them.
- [ ] Add a toggle button that lets you sort the moves in either ascending or descending order.
- [ ] When someone wins, highlight the three squares that caused the win.
- [ ] When no one wins, display a message about the result being a draw.
